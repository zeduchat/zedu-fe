## 1. Executive Summary

**Zedu** is a cross-platform collaboration and learning workspace purpose-built for bootcamps, schools, universities, and cohort-based learning communities. The product consolidates messaging, structured channels, direct messages, voice/video meetings (Buzz), file management, search, notifications, and organization administration into a single environment — eliminating the fragmentation caused by using separate chat apps, conferencing tools, file-sharing services, and learning management utilities.

Zedu is positioned as an **AI-powered education platform** that helps educators organize cohorts, run live classes, manage communication, and scale modern learning — all within one subscription. The platform is available on **Web**, **iOS**, **Android**, and **Desktop**, with real-time synchronization across devices.

**Core value proposition:** Fewer tools, smarter learning. Replace scattered apps with one structured platform for communication, collaboration, and education workflows.

**Claimed impact metrics (marketing):**

- 10,000+ learners supported
- 98% educator satisfaction
- 3× faster cohort coordination
- 40% less admin workload

## 2. Product Vision & Goals

### Vision

To be the unified workspace where educators, administrators, and learners communicate, collaborate, and learn — without context switching between disconnected tools.

### Strategic Goals

| Goal                          | Description                                                        |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Unified communication**     | Provide channels, DMs, threads, and meetings in one interface      |
| **Education-first structure** | Organize conversations by cohort, subject, class, or project       |
| **Real-time collaboration**   | Enable instant messaging, live voice/video, and presence awareness |
| **Centralized resources**     | Offer a single hub for files, media, and shared learning materials |
| **Institutional scalability** | Support multi-org membership, role-based access, and billing tiers |
| **Cross-platform continuity** | Deliver consistent experience across web and native clients        |

### Product Principles

1. **Structure over noise** — Channels and threads keep discussions focused and searchable.
2. **Instant over scheduled** — Buzz enables on-demand voice/video without calendar friction.
3. **Onboarding simplicity** — New organizations and invited members reach productive use quickly.
4. **Role-aware governance** — Permissions scale from guest viewers to organization owners.
5. **Real-time by default** — Messages, notifications, and presence update live via WebSocket infrastructure.

---

## 3. Problem Statement

Modern learning teams — bootcamps, schools, training programs — depend on multiple disconnected tools:

- Chat applications for day-to-day communication
- Video conferencing for live classes
- File-sharing services for learning materials
- Email or LMS announcements for updates
- Separate search across siloed systems

This fragmentation causes:

- **Lost context** when conversations, files, and meetings live in different places
- **Administrative overhead** managing users and permissions across tools
- **Poor discoverability** of past discussions and shared resources
- **Delayed collaboration** when scheduling is required for simple voice discussions
- **Inconsistent learner experience** across web and mobile

Zedu addresses these problems by providing a single, structured environment where all collaboration primitives coexist.
